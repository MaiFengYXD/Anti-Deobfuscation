# Anti-UnveilR-V2

A mirror for my local project.

This is an obfuscation bot for educational purposes only. Based on [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-lua/Prometheus)

> [!NOTE]
> You need to fill the `src/Templates` folder with your own detection template `.luau` files. I do not provide any detections to prevent them from being patched within a few minutes.

To use:

1. Create and configure a `.env` file with your `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `GUILD_ID`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`

Some other tools you might need to install for better usage:

1. LuaJIT
2. Darklua
